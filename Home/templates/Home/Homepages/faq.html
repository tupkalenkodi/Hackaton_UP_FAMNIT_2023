    </h2>
    <div id="answer4" class="answer hidden">
        <p>
            Yes, the generated art content is free to use for commercial purposes. Since the content is

            working to expand the possibilities, and in the near future, we plan to offer generated content in audio and
            video formats as well. This expansion will allow you to experience your art content in even more dynamic
            and engaging ways.
